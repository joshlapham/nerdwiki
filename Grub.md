`/boot/grub/grub.cfg` is auto generated by `update-grub`

The primary configuration file for changing menu display settings is `/etc/default/grub`

There are multiple files for configuring the menu - `/etc/default/grub` mentioned above, and all the files in the `/etc/grub.d/` directory. 

## Change default boot partition

Edit `/etc/default/grub` and change the following line -

`GRUB_DEFAULT=0`

to the menu item you want to boot by default. Run `update-grub` after modifying.

## Reinstall grub from live CD

Tested with Debian Squeeze 6 partition and Debian Lenny 5 live CD using Rescue mode. MUST be same architecture (ie 32 or 64bit)

* Mount root partition from live CD and open a shell
* `aptitude install grub2`
* `grub-mkdevicemap`
* Find partition to install to with `cat /proc/partitions` or use `mount` to see what's already mounted
* `grub-install /dev/sdb`
* `update-grub`

Then reboot.

## Add Windows 7 partition to grub menu

Navigate to `/etc/grub.d` directory. Create new file named `95_windows` or similar. Insert -

	menuentry "Windows 7" {
	set root=(hd0,1)
	chainloader +1
	} 

In this example, /dev/sda2 is the partition we want to boot. Grub starts hd numbers at 0.

Find partition with `cat /proc/partitions` or `fdisk -l`
