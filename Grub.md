## Reinstall grub from live CD

Tested with Debian squeeze 6 partition and Debian lenny 5 live CD using Rescue mode. MUST be same architecture (ie 32 or 64bit)

* Mount root partition from live CD and open a shell
* `aptitude install grub2`
* `grub-mkdevicemap`
* Find partition to install to with `cat /proc/partitions` or use `mount` to see what's already mounted
* `grub-install /dev/sdb`
* `update-grub`

Then reboot.
